This is the backend software for the BookBae project
It is a 'Jakarta RESTful Web Services' application that can be deployed to any standards-compliant Java EE web server. 
It exposes a REST API that clients will use to read and modify data.
The application is built with 'gradle build' (or possibly './gradlew build' or '.\gradlew build')
The above command builds a file 'build/libs/api.war' which can be deployed to a Java EE server like TomEE
