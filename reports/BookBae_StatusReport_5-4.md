Team Report

Goals From Last Week (4/20 - 4/27): "Our goals for next week focus on finalizing specifications, writing tests, setting up continuous integration, and implementing a beta version. Firstly, now that the components have been identified in the project architecture, we will specify documentation for their implementation. Testing will be written to identify desired behaviors. Additionally, the project will add continuous integration into the repository to automatically test new updates. We hope to begin building a demo before the next deliverable to provide a healthy head start. So far, considering our current status, we estimate a normally schedule completion time aligning with the course's deliverables."

This Week (4/27 - 5/4): This week, we set up continuous integration for both our frontend and backend projects. To accomplish this, we fleshed out our testing plan for both codebases as well. We also began deploying 

Goals For Next Week (5/4 - 5/11): Our goal for next week is to prepare our major components (frontend, backend, and database) for the Beta release. For this, we need to finalize the layout of the app and work on refining the interface and design decisions. We will then need to implement those decisions to create a usable Beta release. For the backend, we need to finish writing the database implementation. Additionally, we will need to implement the API endpoints that we need for our Beta release. We did not find time to implement Azure BLOB this week, so we plan on implementing that during the next week. Given the work we have completed so far, we believe we will not have serious issues completing these tasks.
