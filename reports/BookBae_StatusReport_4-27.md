**Team Report**

Goals From Last Week (4/13 - 4/20):
"Next week we will complete the git setup deliverable. We will meet during class time on Thursday (4/21) to receive feedback from Ardi and begin working on the writeup. We will then meet once during the weekend to continue working on the writeup, focusing on the areas that require us to reach a consensus. On Tuesday we will meet to share our progress on our individual milestones."

This Week (4/20 - 4/27):
This week, we finalized the organization of our git project and developed a framework for our software architecture. For the frontend, the application was analyzed and divided into its respective React components for future implementation. Upon identifying the components, we got feedback from user testing on the figma prototype UI and made minor adjustments. For the backend, we identified the necessary APIs to interact with our frontend and database. The database was organized by the information needed. Further details regarding the architecture were added to the living document. Additionally, in accordance with feedback from TAs, we updated the living document to be more clear and succinct (detailed risk assessment, clearer use cases, etc.). Coding Guidelines were established to review pushed code before pulling to the main branch. After writing the remaining implementations and specifications, the project is ready to begin testing and beta implementations.

Goals For Next Week (4/27 - 5/4):
Our goals for next week focus on finalizing specifications, writing tests, setting up continuous integration, and implementing a beta version. Firstly, now that the components have been identified in the project architecture, we will specify documentation for their implementation. Testing will be written to identify desired behaviors. Additionally, the project will add continuous integration into the repository to automatically test new updates. We hope to begin building a demo before the next deliverable to provide a healthy head start. So far, considering our current status, we estimate a normally schedule completion time aligning with the course's deliverables.
