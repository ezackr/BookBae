This Week
- This week we met each other and established our project goals while working on the Requirements and Team Policies document. We met over Zoom on Saturday to fill out a majority of the document, completing following: team info & policies, product description, non functional requirement, external requirements, and most of the team process description. We each worked on a use case on our own between Saturday and our next meeting on Tuesday. At the meeting over Zoom on Tuesday we reviewed the use cases and worked on a schedule for the rest of the project. We decided that meeting during class time worked well for us, and we would try to have individual contributions done by 8PM the night before meetings so we can review everyone's work before the meeting. We worked well together and the only trouble we had was figuring out how to plan out our project agenda for the whole quarter. Our agenda for the next project meeting mainly consists of reviewing our process and requirements from the last deliverable, as well as the schedule we made to make sure our plans are feasible.\
Next Week
- During the next week other working towards the git setup deliverable, we plan on drafting the design of our UI, seting up our server, figuring out databse logistics, find a system to get book information from user input, and research how other apps have chat features embedded. We will also meet multiple times to talk about design and logistics of the project.
