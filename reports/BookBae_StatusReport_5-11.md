**Team Report**
Goals From Last Week (4/27 - 5/4): "Our goal for next week is to prepare our major components (frontend, backend, and database) for the Beta release. For this, we need to finalize the layout of the app and work on refining the interface and design decisions. We will then need to implement those decisions to create a usable Beta release. For the backend, we need to finish writing the database implementation. Additionally, we will need to implement the API endpoints that we need for our Beta release. We did not find time to implement Azure BLOB this week, so we plan on implementing that during the next week. Given the work we have completed so far, we believe we will not have serious issues completing these tasks."

This Week (5/4 - 5/11): This week, we finished the basic components needed for the beta release. We added endpoints for chat, likes, and recommendations, as well as tests for these. We also added screens in the app for each step in the onboarding process, as well as a home screen with a navigation bar. 

Goals For Next Week (5/11 - 5/18): Our goals for next week are to polish our components from the Beta, add more functionality, and write more tests. This will involve adding endpoints to the server to check whether an email is in use, and to store the user's books. It will also require adding methods to Client.js to make requests to those endpoints, which will be called from the appropriate app screens. Additionally, we will need to add logic to the frontend components to validate user input and gracefully handle any errors. Finally, we need to write unit tests for the additional methods in Client.js and for all the react components (login screen, swiping screen, etc.).
