**Team Report**

Last Week (4/6 - 4/12)
-  Last week we set a rough schedule for the quarter in accordance with the expected deliverables. We completed the Requirements and Team Policies document -- the main assignment of the week. 

This Week (4/13 - 4/20)
- On Thursday during class time we met with Ardi to receive feedback for the previous week's assignment. He brought our attention to some key issues, which we aim to improve upon in future deliverables. With the remaining time, we got to work on our UI design. We discussed which frames would encompass our core features, and came up with the following: Profile, Swiping, Messaging, Logging in and Settings. We then came up with a list of features each frame should reasonably support. On Friday after class, we met over Zoom to begin sketching potential layouts. Following this meeting, we each worked independently to finish our respective milestones, then met on Tuesday to complete a progress report. 

Next Week (4/21 - 4/27)
- Next week we will complete the git setup deliverable. We will meet during class time on Thursday (4/21) to receive feedback from Ardi and begin working on the writeup. We will then meet once during the weekend to continue working on the writeup, focusing on the areas that require us to reach a consensus. On Tuesday we will meet to share our progress on our individual milestones.
