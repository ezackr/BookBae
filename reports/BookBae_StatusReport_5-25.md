**Team Report**
Goals From Last Week (5/4 - 5/11): Implement chat, add input validation, implement image uploading, improve the recommendation algorithm, and improve code style.

This Week (5/12 - 5/18): We added the functionality for users to select a match to message with, causing a chatting interface to appear. We made progress toward uploading profile photos on both the front end and the back end, but we ran into some unexpected difficulties, so that is not fully functional. We have also improved the match recommendation algorithm. In addition, we improved documentation.

Goals For Next Week (5/19 - 5/25): Finish implementing any remaining components (particularly the photo upload screen and profile screen) and polish existing components.
