# User Manual:

## Description:

BookBae is an online dating app that matches people based on their literary preferences. A user fills out their profile with all the normal aspects of a dating profile (e.g., name, age, etc.) in addition to their favorite books/genres. When entering BookBae, a user swipes left or right to match with their algorithmically-determined partners. If both users swipe right on each other, they are matched and are able to begin messaging each other. A client uses BookBae to help them find their literary life partner.

## How to Install: 

BookBae is currently still under production, but will be soon available for free on the Android App Store. Once it is available to install, simply download the app through the app store!

Sidenote: While the app is in production, an emulator version can be run using Android Studio. To do so, download Android Studio and follow the Setup Instructions (both frontend and backend) in the top-level README.md file. 

## How to Run:
Like any other app, BookBae is run by opening the app on your android device. For the developer emulator version, run the app by following the "Setup Instructions (frontend)" from the top-level README.md file. 

## How to Use:
On your first use of the app, you will need to create an account. Press the "Create Account" button on the login screen to begin the sign up process. Fill out the information you would like in your profile. The profile creation process involves writing a short bio, uploading a profile picture, and selecting some of your favorite books through the Book Picker. After finishing the sign up process, the user enters BookBae and can login with their email and password for subsequent uses. A user's profile can be edited at any time from the "Profile" page on the Home Screen (WORK IN PROGRESS). 

Upon entering the Home Screen, the user is prompted with an overview of other user's profiles, known as the swiping screen. If a user likes their proposed match, they can swipe right for "interested" and swipe left for "not interested". If two users both swipe right on each other, they are notified of the new match and can navigate to the chat section to begin a conversation (WORK IN PROGRESS).
